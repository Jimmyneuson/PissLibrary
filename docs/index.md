# PissLibrary

## About
A piss library for all your piss needs. This includes an easy to understand interface and beautifully written documentation. I also assure you, there is no piss in this library. Never again will you have to worry about studying to use a simple library or even ~~shit~~ in your piss library. Just use it out of the box!

## Support
You can support me and this library by pinging and thanking me in the roblox discord server (jimmyneuson#3519).
